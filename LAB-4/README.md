# JavaScript Quiz Game

This project is a simple JavaScript quiz game that runs entirely in the browser console. 
It uses arrays, loops, functions, and conditionals to display questions, take user input using `prompt()`, 
and give instant feedback with `alert()`. The user’s input is cleaned using `toLowerCase()` and `trim()` to 
ensure accurate answer checking. A score counter tracks correct responses throughout the quiz. After all questions are answered,
the final score is displayed. This project helps reinforce core JavaScript concepts without requiring any HTML or DOM manipulation.
